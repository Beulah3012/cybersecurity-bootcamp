# 1. Import the socket module for network communication
import socket

# 2. Ask the user to enter a host (like "localhost" or a website)
host = input("Enter host (e.g., localhost): ")

# 3. Create a list of ports we want to scan (commonly used web ports)
ports = [80, 443]

# 4. Loop through each port in the list
for port in ports:
    try:
        # 5. This is where the socket connection code would go
        # Right now, it does nothing because of the 'pass' statement
        pass

    # 6. If any error happens during scanning, print a message
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error scanning port {port}: {e}")
